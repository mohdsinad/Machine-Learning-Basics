# Machine Learning Basics

This repository provides an introduction to fundamental concepts in machine learning. It is designed to help beginners understand the core principles and techniques used in the field. Starting with the basics of Numpy, you will learn about array creation, indexing, slicing, and basic operations. The journey continues with vector operations such as addition, subtraction, dot products, and scalar multiplication, followed by matrix operations like addition, multiplication, transposition, and inversion. The concept of linear transformations is introduced, showcasing their representation using matrices. Fundamental principles of differentiation are reviewed, highlighting their importance in machine learning. Gradient descent is explored in detail, starting with single-variable optimization and extending to two-variable functions, including visualizations of the optimization process. Finally, the perceptron algorithm is implemented for regression, providing a practical foundation in machine learning concepts.
